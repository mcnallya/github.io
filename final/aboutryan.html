		<h1>About The Shirts</h1>
		<p>The idea came to me kind of randomly just while talking with friends, I thought of it, and I brought up the idea to them. They agreed it was funny, so we decided to be the guinea pigs and ordered the first few shirts.<br>
			The words are misspelled just because thatâ€™s what makes the shirts funny, and that was the idea I came up with.<br>
			Word got out about the shirts in a few ways.
		<ul class="items">
			<li>When me and a couple friends wore the shirts, others saw them and some of those who saw it wanted one.</li>
			<li>I asked around to see if people would want to buy a shirt. </li>
			<li>I marketed on social media, mostly using Snapchat to reach more people at once. The rest is history.</li>
